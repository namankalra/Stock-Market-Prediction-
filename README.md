Datasets
1. STOCKS.csv
   I use the huge news dataset available on kaggle. The dataset contains the various stock prices of various companies in varying sectors. The stock prices available range from the year 1997-2017. Each companyâ€™s dataset file has a date, opening stock price, highest stock price for the day, lowest stock price for the day, closing stock price and total volume traded which is the total number of shares bought and sold on that particular day and an open interest.
